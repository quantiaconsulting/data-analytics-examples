# Example of data analysis in python

This project provides the python resources related to a course on *Data Analytics in Python* offered by [Quantia Consuting](http://quantiaconsulting.com/) in collaboration with [CEFRIEL](https://cefriel.com/) 

The course provides the basic knowledge to understand the role of the python language and its libraries in the context of the main descriptive and predictive data analysis methods. In particular, it explains why python plays such a key role in the Data Science community. 

In the folders, you find a list of business problems solved using machine learning algorithms implemented in python.

* Predict house pricing with Linear Regression using numpy and Seaborn
* Classify wines as good or bad with Logistic regression using  Scikit-learn and Seaborn
* Classify wines quality with Decision Trees and Random Forests using Scikit-learn
* Clustering flowers with K-means using Scikit-learn and Seaborn
